            Chatbots are Artificially-Intelligent Software’s showing
            responsiveness towards the existing queries. Those queries may
            either be of a student or an employee, depending upon the
            requirements in real-times. But this project will promisingly let
            the beginners prepare a software whose database is cloud-based and
            let a student get responses for the queries he/she may enter. Are
            you curious to know how this project will be identifying the
            answers? With NLP i.e Natural Language Processing and ML i.e Machine
            Learning algorithms, a list of appropriate responses will be entered
            in those chatbots which will answer the questions (these are the
            input patterns) of a student in a goal-oriented manner. This is one
            of the reasons why the project is popular and preferred by many
            cloud-computing aspirants. Besides, the thing which can’t be avoided
            in this project is connectivity with a website you are using. After
            the website is linked with the chatbot, you will be able to analyse
            how many users have started talking with the chatbot and to what
            extent the project is accurately and precisely answering to the
            variety of visitors always waiting for someone to help them fulfil
            their requirements.{" "}

            Bug Tracker isn’t only simple but effective to use for identifying
            and killing a variety of bugs. Those bugs may occur due to errors in
            communication, syntax, calculations, or commands. Thinking how such
            bugs may be identified in a shorter span! For doing the same, a
            person using this tracker (who may either be an administrator, staff
            member, or some customer) will determine the type and source of the
            bug just by logging in to this application via a valid username and
            strong password. Then, the person may review the details regarding
            the bug like the date of bug creation, the time for which the bug
            lasted in the system, and so on. In case the bug isn’t related
            directly or indirectly to the administrator, he/she may transfer its
            details to a staff member or vice versa. If required, the bug
            details may also be sent to the customers if the same (i.e. bug) is
            troubling them. The benefit will be that the customers not able to
            find solutions for that bug will directly by contacting the
            administrator for the much-required solutions. In this manner, the
            customers need not waste their time analysing the searches and
            labels of this Bug Tracker as the administrator has provided the
            solutions that can detect and eliminate a bug in a shorter span.{" "}

          <p>
            Blood Banking is a process that utilizes well, the existing
            scientific methods, for facilitating the transfusion of blood.
            Depending upon the blood type and availability of donors in that
            particular area, this project can cater to such parameters well
            through a central database strengthened with the computing power of
            scalable and efficient cloud storage. You may think about how the
            doctors and other professional medical experts will identify which
            donor is the best! The answer is the previous track records. This
            online cloud-based Blood Banking system will highlight the key
            contributions of the donors in previous months or years and
            determine the quality of results produced by his/her blood. With
            this, doctors and other practitioners are now assured with the ease
            of access to blood (either A+, B+, AB+, or O-) during an emergency
            period. Also, this will be helping the beginners understand the
            importance of blood banks and what are the consequences patients
            need to face when the blood which could be transfused to their veins
            isn’t provided at their booked slots.

          <p>
            Attendance Tracker could be an award-winning project for college
            students or beginners in the field of cloud computing. This is
            because such a tracker will help investigate anomalies in the
            current attendance records. With this tracker, students may
            hypnotize their teachers or experienced authorities of management
            because the tracker has so much potential that it can identify which
            students are irregular to their classes and not ready to establish
            connectivity with the actual concepts of their curriculum’s
            subjects. The tracker works fine with Azure cloud that manages the
            analytics and networking of cloud-oriented applications well. As
            soon as you enter a student’s Enrolment Number or Name, details like
            availability in classes, number of lectures attended will be
            displayed and no proxies are possible since the tracker is supported
            by Azure cloud capabilities. Even the security offered is so robust
            and powerful that those naughty students who always fool their deans
            are caught in a shorter span – just after the admin enters login
            details into this tracker. All this will improve accuracy and
            transparency in any of the educational institutions as students and
            their parents are pre-informed about the real-time status of leave
            requests and absenteeism in a confidential manner and at reduced
            costs.
